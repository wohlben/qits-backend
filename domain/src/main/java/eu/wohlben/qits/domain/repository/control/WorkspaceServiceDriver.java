/**
 * Drives the in-container workspace-daemon's <b>services</b> (dev servers) and receives their
 * lifecycle events — the supervision half of the daemon's autonomous startup (clone → config →
 * bootstrap → <b>services</b>), inverted onto the control socket (docs/epics/qits-workspace-daemon/
 * Part 4). Framework-free so it lives in {@code domain}; the real implementation is the backend
 * {@code WorkspaceDaemonRegistry} (service module). Apps without the backend impl (cli, tests with
 * no daemon) provide a test double or have no bean; the host coordinator injects it as {@code
 * Instance<>} and falls back to the tmux path when it is absent (the degradation contract).
 *
 * <p>Unlike {@link WorkspaceBootstrapDriver} (a bounded await of a one-shot chain), services are
 * long-lived, so this is <b>push/continuous</b>: the daemon owns the process lifecycle
 * (spawn/restart/backoff/policy/group-kill) and streams every transition; the host {@linkplain
 * #subscribe subscribes} once at startup and projects the events into its display state machine,
 * process segments, and web-view proxy. The host issues only <b>subsequent</b> operations — {@link
 * #startService manual start} and {@link #signalService stop} — never auto-start, which the daemon
 * self-runs.

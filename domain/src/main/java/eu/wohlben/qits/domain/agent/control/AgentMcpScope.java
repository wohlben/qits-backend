/**
 * Which MCP server an agent session is launched with, and how it is scoped. Replaces the old {@code
 * ActionVariant} {@code CLAUDE_*} values — the "spawn Claude with an MCP server" concept is no
 * longer an action variant but a first-class agent launch parameter, resolved to a scoped server
 * URL by {@link AgentLaunchService}.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #ACTIONS} — the "actions" server, scoped to the repository the session runs in (for
 *       managing that repository's actions).
 *   <li>{@link #REPOSITORY} — the "repository" server, scoped to the session's project and narrowed
 *       to that one repository (for driving a single repository from within a subtree).
 *   <li>{@link #PROJECT} — the "repository" server scoped to the whole project, with no repository
 *       narrowing (for driving every repository in the project).

 * {@code Instance<>} that is simply empty in apps without the backend (cli, tests with no daemon).
 *
 * <p>Distinct from {@link WorkspaceDaemonProvisioner} (which drives provisioning): this is an
 * on-demand read. It replaces the host-side, {@code mainBranch}-only DB config store as the source
 * of a workspace's actions/daemons/bootstrap list — the UI/read-path rewire lands with the config
 * single-source-of-truth part.

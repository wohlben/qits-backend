/**
 * Drives (and awaits) the in-container workspace-daemon's bootstrap chain — the
 * install/migrate/seed commands the daemon runs from its own {@code .qits-config.yml}, between the
 * self-clone and daemon start (docs/epics/qits-workspace-daemon/ Part 3). Framework-free so it
 * lives in {@code domain}; the real implementation is the backend {@code WorkspaceDaemonRegistry}
 * (service module), reached over the control socket. Apps without the backend impl (cli, tests with
 * no daemon) provide a test double or simply have no bean; the runner injects it as {@code
 * Instance<>}.
 *
 * <p>Two entry points share the same wait machinery. On a <b>fresh provision</b> the daemon runs
 * the chain autonomously (no request); the host only {@link #awaitBootstrap awaits} the terminal
 * outcome, feeding each step's progress to a {@link StepSink}. A <b>manual re-run</b> from the
 * workspace surface {@link #runBootstrap sends} the daemon a run request and then awaits the same
 * way.
 *
 * <p>Distinct from {@link WorkspaceDaemonProvisioner} (clone) and {@link WorkspaceConfigReader}
 * (read): this one runs the chain. The host records the streamed outcomes and gates service
 * auto-start on {@link Result#ok()} — a failed chain withholds {@code WorkspaceReadyForServices}.

/**
 * What kind of part of its project a repository is.
 *
 * <p>The four <b>placeable</b> archetypes ({@link #SERVICE}, {@link #LIBRARY}, {@link
 * #INTEGRATION}, {@link #APPLICATION}) are exactly the directories of the project template skeleton
 * every {@link #PROJECT} wrapper is seeded with — directory <em>is</em> archetype, in both
 * directions: a directory extracted out of {@code libs/} into a sibling repository becomes a {@code
 * LIBRARY}, and a {@code LIBRARY} is mounted back under {@code libs/}. The mapping lives here
 * rather than being derived from the name, because it doesn't derive mechanically ({@code libs} !=
 * {@code LIBRARY}, {@code apps} != {@code APPLICATION}).
 *
 * <p>{@link #SERVICE_TEMPLATE} and {@link #FORK} are deliberately unplaceable: neither is a
 * component of <em>this</em> application (one is scaffolding a component is generated from, the
 * other an external downstream fork), so neither has a home in the wrapper's tree nor is a valid
 * extraction target. {@link #PROJECT} is unplaceable for the opposite reason — it <em>is</em> the
 * tree.
 *
 * <p>Adding a value here also requires a Flyway migration: {@code Repository.archetype} carries a
 * DB check constraint over the value set (V44 rebuilt V1's inline one as the named {@code
 * CK_repository_archetype}).

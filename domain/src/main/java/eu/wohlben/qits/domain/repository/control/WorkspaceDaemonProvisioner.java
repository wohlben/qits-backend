/**
 * Awaits the in-container workspace-daemon's <b>autonomous self-provision</b> — on boot the daemon
 * clones {@code /workspace} and materializes submodules entirely from its injected env, then
 * reports the outcome up over the control socket. This is the qits-side await; it sends the daemon
 * nothing (the whole point of the autonomous model — docs/epics/qits-workspace-daemon/ Part 1).
 * Framework-free so it lives in {@code domain}; the real implementation is the backend {@code
 * WorkspaceDaemonRegistry} (service module), reached over the socket.
 *
 * <p>Apps without the backend impl (cli, tests with no daemon) have no bean — {@link
 * WorkspaceService} injects it as {@code Instance<>} and, finding it empty, runs the host-driven
 * clone (exactly today's behaviour). Distinct from {@link WorkspaceDaemonLiveness}, which is
 * observational only; this one drives behaviour.

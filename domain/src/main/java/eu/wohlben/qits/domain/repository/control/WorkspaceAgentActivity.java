/**
 * The live coding-agent activity a workspace's in-container {@code workspace-daemon} reported over
 * its dial-home socket (docs/epics/qits-coding-agents/ agent-activity tracking). Framework-free (no
 * websockets type) so it lives in {@code domain}; the {@code service} module implements it over
 * {@code WorkspaceDaemonRegistry}, and {@link WorkspaceService} reads it as an {@code Instance<>}
 * that is simply empty in apps without the backend (e.g. {@code cli}, tests). Sibling of {@link
 * WorkspaceGitStatus}.
 *
 * <p>The value is a per-workspace <b>rollup</b> across that workspace's currently-tracked agent
 * commands (precedence BUSY &gt; WAITING &gt; IDLE), cached in-memory only while the daemon is
 * connected (the container is RUNNING); {@link Optional#empty()} means "no active agent / unknown".
 * The daemon re-reports on every reconnect, so a qits restart self-heals within one socket
 * round-trip.
